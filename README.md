DS_Projects repository contains projects i have worked on while doing my Data Science studies.

1. Imange Classification of waste - this is my capstone project where I developed a model to predict patients at risk of developing 
heart disease to allow for early mitigation thus saving lives and reducing related medical expenditure. 

2. Classification of car sales customers - Developed a model to predict patients at risk of developing heart disease to allow for 
early mitigation thus saving lives and reducing related medical expenditure.

3. Identify patients at risk of hear disease - Developed a model to classify potential/new customers. The model can assist marketing
 and customer service personnel to package their products and services to improve customer experience resulting in a higher Lead to
